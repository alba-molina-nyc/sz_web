<h3>Psychopharmacological Management</h3>
<p>Medications designed to treat mental disorders aren’t as straightforward as pills for your blood pressure or high cholesterol. It often takes a trial-and-error approach to find the right combination of medication and talk therapy to relieve your ongoing symptoms. Your doctor at Szuster Psychiatry is an expert at medication management, from prescribing the original dosage to monitoring your reactions and making necessary adjustments. Specializing in teleconferencing for psychiatric disorders, your psychotherapist provides psychiatric medical care and the most modern, effective medication management to patients in Jackson Heights, New York and Greater New York City Area. Call today for an appointment.</p>

<h5>What is Medication Management?</h5>
<p>Medication alone, or in tandem with talk therapy, plays a vital role in treating many mental health disorders. Finding the right medication to effectively manage the symptoms of disorders such as ADHD/ADD, depression and anxiety requires the expertise of a highly trained psychiatrist.</p>

<p>People don’t always react to psychiatric drug treatment the same way. What works for one person may not work for another. This variability makes medication management an essential part of psychiatric medical care and another reason to choose your psychiatrist with care.</p>

  
<p>At Szuster Psychiatry, you’ll find a wide range of mental health services for those living in the Greater New York City area. These services include prescribing and managing psychiatric medications. Some types of medicine can be prescribed through telepsychiatry, while others may require in-person visits.</p>
<h5>How does Medication Management Work?</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Evaluating your need for psychiatric medication in mental health treatment</li>
  <li>Choosing one of the many available medication options</li>
  <li>Monitoring your use of the prescribed drugs</li>
  <li>Making adjustments to the type of medication and dosage as needed</li>
  <li>Verifying the outcome of your treatment</li>
</ul>
<h3>Psychotherapy</h3>
<p>
  Whether you’re coping with depression due to job loss or anxiety about potential hardships to come, psychotherapy treatment is an effective means of learning how to change your thinking, attitude and behavior. More commonly referred to as talk therapy, supportive psychotherapy services are available in New York, New Jersey and Florida.

<h5>What is Psychotherapy</h5>
<p>Talk therapy is based on a cooperative, goal-oriented relationship that you form with your psychiatrist. Just like the name implies, talk therapy involves frank discussions with your therapist to work through your problems. The goal is to help you live a more productive, and healthier life.</p>
<p>You’re not alone in suffering from a mental health disorder that prevents you from living life to the fullest. The National Institutes of Health reports that more than 31 percent of American adults experience an anxiety disorder at some point in their lives.

  <li>Bipolar</li>
  <li>Obssessive compulsive disorder OCD</li>
  <li>PTSD</li>

</ul>
<h5>How does Psychotherapy Work?</h5>
